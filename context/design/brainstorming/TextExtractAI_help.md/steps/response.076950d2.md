# response:

You're hitting on a very common point of confusion when working with AI models and their integration into code! The way you're thinking about interacting with the AI in a `.md` file is different from how you interact with it *through* your `.ts` code.

Let's break down your questions:

1. **"How do I upload an image to you?"**
   * **You don't upload an image *to me* (the AI model directly) in the way you might upload a file to a website.** Instead, you provide the image *data* to your `TextExtractionConcept` class when you call its methods.
   * In your `extractTextFromMedia` method, the `image` parameter is expected to be a `FilePath`. This means it's a string representing the path to an image file on your system (or accessible by your application).
   * Your code then uses `fs.promises.readFile(resolvedPath)` to read the contents of that image file into a `buffer`.
   * This `buffer` is what gets passed to the LLM (presumably through `this.geminiLLM.executeLLM`). The LLM then processes the image data.

2. **"How do I call prompt in .ts file like I how do in .md files where I can just type '# prompt ....' and get a response"**
   * The `# prompt ...` syntax you're seeing in `.md` files is a **special markdown extension or feature of a specific tool or platform you might be using.** It's not standard TypeScript or JavaScript. This syntax is likely designed to:
     * **Instruct an AI assistant to *generate* content within the markdown file itself.**
     * **Or, to *execute* a prompt against an AI service and embed the result.**
   * **In your `.ts` file, you don't use `# prompt ...`.** Instead, you write regular TypeScript code that:
     * Constructs a **string variable** that *contains* your prompt.
     * Calls a method on an AI client object (like `this.geminiLLM.executeLLM`) and passes that prompt string to it.
     * The AI client then sends the prompt (and potentially other data, like the image buffer) to the AI service.
     * The AI service processes it and sends back a response.
     * Your TypeScript code receives that response and processes it.

**Let's illustrate with your `extractTextFromMedia` method:**

```typescript
  async extractTextFromMedia({
    image, // This is the FilePath (e.g., "/path/to/your/image.jpg")
  }: {
    image: FilePath;
  }): Promise<{ results: ExtractionResultId[] } | { error: string }> {
    try {
      // ... file existence checks ...

      const resolvedPath = path.resolve(image);
      const buffer = await fs.promises.readFile(resolvedPath); // Reading image data

      // THIS IS YOUR PROMPT STRING
      const prompt =
        `You are an OCR assistant. Read all visible text in the given image
        and return only the readable text. Do not describe the image or repeat the base64 data.
        Return plain text only, formatted for readability by numbering each text block you recognize.
        Also keep track of the position of each text block in the image, using coordinates.
        Coordinates are given as (x,y) pairs, where (0,0) is the top-left corner of the image.
        The 'from' coordinate is the top-left corner of the text block, and the 'to' coordinate is
        the bottom-right corner. The coordinates should be integers representing pixel positions in the image
        relative to the image dimensions. If no text can be found, return "No text found". When two or more
        short text segments appear close together (within the same logical phrase or line group), merge them
        into a single text block rather than splitting them. Treat small vertical spacing as part of the same
        block if the text forms a continuous sentence or title.
        Do not add, infer, or search for any information that is not explicitly readable.
        Do not use external knowledge or guess missing words based on what the image might represent.
        Apply the same grouping logic for all languages — English, Chinese, or others — merging vertically or
        horizontally aligned characters that form a single title or phrase.
        When estimating coordinates, ensure that (from) and (to) precisely cover only the visible text area.
        Avoid random or uniform coordinates that do not match the actual layout.
        Keep numeric elements together with their associated words (e.g., “2025” and “Festival”)
        in a single text block whenever they belong to the same phrase or visual line.
        The incoming image's dimensions is ${dimensions.width}x${dimensions.height}. Label text blocks with accurate coordinates
        that are relevant to the image's dimensions.
        Strictly follow this format, with no extra commentary:
        An example response format:
        1: <text> (from: {x:12, y:34}, to: {x:56, y:78})
        2: <text> (from: {x:90, y:12}, to: {x:34, y:56})
        ...
        N: <text> (from: {x:A, y:B}, to: {x:C, y:D})
        Number of text blocks: N`;

      // THIS IS WHERE YOU CALL THE LLM WITH THE PROMPT AND IMAGE DATA
      const llmResponse = await this.geminiLLM.executeLLM(prompt, buffer); // Assuming executeLLM takes buffer

      // ... rest of your code to parse the response ...
    } catch (error: any) {
      // ... error handling ...
    }
  }
```

**In summary:**

* **Image Upload:** You provide the image *data* (as a `buffer` after reading a file path) to your function.
* **Prompting:** You define your prompt as a standard JavaScript/TypeScript string. You then pass this string to an AI client's method (like `this.geminiLLM.executeLLM`) along with the necessary data (the image buffer). The `# prompt ...` syntax is a feature of specific markdown editors/tools, not a code construct.

You are effectively "uploading" the image by passing its data when calling the method, and you are "prompting" the AI by passing a specially crafted string to its interface.
