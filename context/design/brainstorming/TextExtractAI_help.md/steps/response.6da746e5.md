# response:

You're asking a very important question about how the `GeminiLLM` class is intended to be used within the `TextExtraction` class, and why it's not explicitly imported in the provided `TextExtraction` code.

Let's break this down:

## Why isn't `GeminiLLM` explicitly imported in `TextExtraction`?

The provided `TextExtraction` code is structured as a **class that *manages* text extraction results**, not necessarily as the *direct orchestrator* of the AI call itself.

Think of it this way:

* **`GeminiLLM`:** This is the tool that *knows how to talk to the AI*. It has the API key, knows the prompt, and handles the communication with Google's service.
* **`TextExtraction`:** This class is responsible for:
  * **Holding the *results* of text extraction.** It has a `results` array to store `ExtractionResult` objects.
  * **Providing actions to *manipulate* these results** (like editing text, editing locations, adding, deleting).
  * **Having methods to *parse* LLM output** (`extractDeclaredCount`, `parseNumberedTextList`, `parseCoordinatesList`).

The `extractTextFromMedia` method in `TextExtraction` *does* call the `llm.executeLLM` method, which is the core of your question. However, the `GeminiLLM` class itself isn't imported directly into the `TextExtraction` file because it's likely intended to be **injected** or **passed as an argument** to the `TextExtraction` class. This is a common design pattern for promoting dependency injection and making classes more testable and flexible.

## How to call for AI inside your code (and why `GeminiLLM` isn't imported in `TextExtraction`)

The way the `TextExtraction` class is designed, you **don't import `GeminiLLM` directly into the `TextExtraction` file**. Instead, you create an instance of `GeminiLLM` *outside* of `TextExtraction` and then **pass that instance** to the `TextExtraction` class when you need to perform an extraction.

Here's how you would typically use it:

1. **Create an instance of `GeminiLLM`:** You'll need your API key.
2. **Create an instance of `TextExtraction`:** This class will hold the extracted data.
3. **Call the `extractTextFromMedia` method on the `TextExtraction` instance, passing the `GeminiLLM` instance to it.**

Let's illustrate with an example of how you'd use these classes in a main application file or a service that orchestrates this process:

```typescript
// Assuming your files are structured like this:
// src/llm/gemini-llm.ts
// src/text-extraction/text-extraction.ts
// src/main.ts (or wherever your main logic resides)

import { GeminiLLM } from './llm/gemini-llm'; // Adjust path as needed
import { TextExtraction } from './text-extraction/text-extraction'; // Adjust path as needed
import * as path from 'path'; // For path manipulation

// --- Your API Key ---
// In a real application, this would come from environment variables or a config service.
const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY';

async function processImageForTextExtraction(imageFilePath: string): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Initialize GeminiLLM
  const geminiLLM = new GeminiLLM({ apiKey: GEMINI_API_KEY });

  // 2. Initialize TextExtraction
  const textExtractor = new TextExtraction();

  try {
    // 3. Call the extraction method, passing the LLM instance
    // The extractTextFromMedia method in TextExtraction accepts the LLM instance.
    const llmResponse = await textExtractor.extractTextFromMedia(geminiLLM, imageFilePath);

    console.log('LLM Raw Response:', llmResponse);

    // Now you can use the methods of textExtractor to work with the results
    console.log('Extracted Text Blocks:', textExtractor.getAll());

    // Example of further manipulation using TextExtraction's methods:
    // Let's say we want to edit the first extracted text block
    if (textExtractor.results.length > 0) {
      textExtractor.editExtractText(0, "This is the corrected text.");
      console.log('After editing text:', textExtractor.getAll());
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to process image:', error);
  }
}

// --- Example Usage ---
async function runExample() {
  // Make sure you have an image file named 'sample.png' in the same directory
  // or provide a correct path to an image.
  const exampleImagePath = path.join(__dirname, 'sample.png'); // Adjust path as necessary

  // Create a dummy image file if it doesn't exist for demonstration
  if (!fs.existsSync(exampleImagePath)) {
    console.warn(`Warning: ${exampleImagePath} not found. Creating a dummy image for demonstration.`);
    // In a real scenario, you'd need an actual image library to create one.
    // For now, we'll just create an empty file to avoid immediate file not found errors,
    // but the LLM call will likely fail or return "No text found" without actual image data.
    try {
      fs.writeFileSync(exampleImagePath, Buffer.from('dummy image data')); // This is NOT a valid image file
      console.log('Created a dummy image file. LLM call will likely fail.');
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Failed to create dummy image file:', e);
      return;
    }
  }

  await processImageForTextExtraction(exampleImagePath);
}

// Call the example function
runExample();

```

**Key changes and explanations in the example above:**

1. **`import { GeminiLLM } from './llm/gemini-llm';`**: `GeminiLLM` is imported where it's *used*, not necessarily where `TextExtraction` is defined.
2. **`import { TextExtraction } from './text-extraction/text-extraction';`**: `TextExtraction` is imported.
3. **`const geminiLLM = new GeminiLLM({ apiKey: GEMINI_API_KEY });`**: An instance of `GeminiLLM` is created.
4. **`const textExtractor = new TextExtraction();`**: An instance of `TextExtraction` is created.
5. **`await textExtractor.extractTextFromMedia(geminiLLM, imageFilePath);`**: This is the crucial part. The `geminiLLM` instance is passed as the *first argument* to `extractTextFromMedia`.

**Why is `GeminiLLM` not imported directly into `TextExtraction.ts`?**

* **Dependency Injection:** This design pattern makes `TextExtraction` more reusable. It doesn't care *how* the `GeminiLLM` is initialized or what specific API it uses, as long as it conforms to the `GeminiLLM` interface (or has the `executeLLM` method).
* **Testability:** You can easily mock `GeminiLLM` when testing `TextExtraction` to simulate LLM responses without actually calling the API.
* **Flexibility:** If you later decide to use a different LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI), you would create a new LLM class (e.g., `OpenAILLM`) with a similar `executeLLM` method and then pass an instance of that new class to `TextExtraction` without modifying `TextExtraction` itself.

**You'll need to adjust your `TextExtraction` class's `extractTextFromMedia` method to accept the `GeminiLLM` instance.**

Here's how your `TextExtraction` class's `extractTextFromMedia` method *should* look to accommodate this:

```typescript
// In text-extraction/text-extraction.ts

import { GeminiLLM } from '../llm/gemini-llm'; // Adjust path as needed
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import sizeOf from 'image-size';

// ---------- State Types ----------
export interface Coordinates {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

export interface ExtractionResult {
  source: string; // filename
  extractedText: string;
  fromCoord: Coordinates;
  toCoord: Coordinates;
}

export class TextExtraction {
  public results: ExtractionResult[] = [];

  // ... (other methods like extractDeclaredCount, parseNumberedTextList, parseCoordinatesList)

  // Modified to accept the LLM instance
  async extractTextFromMedia(llm: GeminiLLM, imagePath: string): Promise<string> {
    try {
      if (!fs.existsSync(imagePath)) throw new Error("Image file not found");
      console.log(`🧠 Extracting text from: ${imagePath}`);
      const resolvedPath = path.resolve(imagePath);
      const buffer = await fs.promises.readFile(resolvedPath);
      const dimensions = sizeOf(buffer);
      if (!dimensions.width || !dimensions.height) {
        throw new Error("Unable to determine image dimensions");
      }
      console.log(`Image dimensions: ${dimensions.width}x${dimensions.height}`);

      const payload = `You are an OCR assistant. Read all visible text in the given image
      and return only the readable text. Do not describe the image or repeat the base64 data.
      Return plain text only, formatted for readability by numbering each text block u recognize.
      Also keep track of the position of each text block in the image, using coordinates.
      Coordinates are given as (x,y) pairs, where (0,0) is the top-left corner of the image.
      The 'from' coordinate is the top-left corner of the text block, and the 'to' coordinate is
      the bottom-right corner. The coordinates should be integers representing pixel positions in the image
      relative to the image dimensions. If no text can be found, return "No text found". When two or more
      short text segments appear close together (within the same logical phrase or line group), merge them
      into a single text block rather than splitting them. Treat small vertical spacing as part of the same
      block if the text forms a continuous sentence or title.
      Do not add, infer, or search for any information that is not explicitly readable.
      Do not use external knowledge or guess missing words based on what the image might represent.
      Apply the same grouping logic for all languages — English, Chinese, or others — merging vertically or
      horizontally aligned characters that form a single title or phrase.
      When estimating coordinates, ensure that (from) and (to) precisely cover only the visible text area.
      Avoid random or uniform coordinates that do not match the actual layout.
      Keep numeric elements together with their associated words (e.g., “2025” and “Festival”)
      in a single text block whenever they belong to the same phrase or visual line.
      The incoming image's dimensions is ${dimensions.width}x${dimensions.height}. Label textblocks with accurate coordinates
      that is relevant to the image's dimensions.
      Strictly follow this format, with no extra commentary:
      An example response format:
      1: <text> (from: {x:12, y:34}, to: {x:56, y:78})
      2: <text> (from: {x:90, y:12}, to: {x:34, y:56})
      ...
      N: <text> (from: {x:A, y:B}, to: {x:C, y:D})
      Number of text blocks: N`;

      // Pass prompt + image to Gemini using the provided LLM instance
      const text = await llm.executeLLM(payload, imagePath); // <-- LLM is called here

      const resultList = this.parseNumberedTextList(text);
      const coords = this.parseCoordinatesList(text);

      for (let i = 0; i < resultList.length; i++) {
        this.results.push({
          source: path.basename(imagePath),
          extractedText: resultList[i],
          // Use provided coords, fallback to 0,0 if missing or invalid
          fromCoord: coords[i]?.fromCoord || { x: 0, y: 0 },
          toCoord: coords[i]?.toCoord || { x: 0, y: 0 },
        });
      }
      return text;

    } catch (error) {
      console.error('❌ Error extracting text:', (error as Error).message);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  // ... rest of your TextExtraction class methods ...
}
```
