# prompt

error: Leaks detected:

* 3 timers were started in this test, but never completed. This is often caused by not calling `clearTimeout`.
* 4 async calls to op\_read were started in this test, but never completed.
* A TLS connection was opened/accepted during the test, but not closed during the test. Close the TLS connection by calling `tlsConn.close()`.
  To get more details where leaks occurred, run again with the --trace-leaks flag.

also any isn't allowed to be use in the code. So I changed any to ID, but then for .\_getTranslation, translateID is needed but I can't get translated ID

fix the leak error in the testing code
