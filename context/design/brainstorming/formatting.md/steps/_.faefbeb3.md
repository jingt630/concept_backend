# Concept TextExtraction

**Concept** TextExtraction

**Purpose** Extract text from uploaded media for the AI to learn and translate

**Principle** Given a MediaFile, AI would run extraction to recognize text within the media, and produce a transcript with metadata for the media. One media can have many ExtractionResults.

**State**
a set of ExtractionResults with
\- imagePath (FilePath)
\- extractedText (String)
\- position(Location)
\- textId (String)

```
a set of Location with
    - an ExtractionResult
    - two Coordinate (Number,Number)
```

**Actions**

extractTextFromMedia(image:FilePath): (result: ExtractionResult)
**require:** image exists in application and accessible
**effect:** create new ExtractionResults that is associated with the image, with the same path string as imagePath stored,
extractedText will be the text the AI recognizes at position, and assign an unique textId out of all the ExtractionResults
with the same imagePath because the same image can have many same words at different location

editExtractText(extractedText:ExtractionResult, newText:String)
**require** extractedText exists
**effect** modify extractedText in extraction to newText

editLocation(extractedText:ExtractionResult, fromCoord: Coordinate, toCoord: Coordinate)
**require** extractedText exists, the coordinates doesn't include negative numbers
**effect** change position of extractedText to a new location with fromCoord and toCoord that gives us the area of image that the extractedText occupies if a rectangle is drawn from FromCoord to ToCoord

addExtractionTxt(media: FilePath, fromCoord: Coordinate, toCoord: Coordinate):(result: ExtractionResult)
**require** media exists, numbers are non-negative.
**effect** Creates a new ExtractionResult with the same media, initiate extractedText as empty, an unique textId
basing off of the filepath, and the location created from the two given coordinates.

deleteExtraction(textId:String, imagePath:FilePath)
**require** textId exists in the imagePath
**effect** remove the extractedResult with textId

format this into the given concept format like this:
