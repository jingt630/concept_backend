# prompt: # Concept 4

**Concept** OutputRender\[MediaFile]

**Purpose** Re-render translated content back into the media, such as subtitles for videos or redrawn text in images.

**Principle** Given a MediaFile and its translations, the system generates output versions.

**State**

a set of OutputVersion with

```
- base (MediaFile)
- translation (Translations)
```

**Actions**

render(translation:Translation):(output:OutputVersion)
**require:** translation exist
**effect:** generate a rendered output with translations embedded in the positions of the associated MediaFile described by the data stored in the ExtractionResult for each translation

export(output: OutputVersion, destination: String, type: String): (file: File)
**require:** output exists, destination exists in the device of the user, type is reasonable (example: png to jpg)
**effect:** save or download output in the chosen type to the destination on the user's device

You are violating modularity in your concepts. Remember that concepts should not know anything about each other, so for example in your OutputRender concept, you cannot just pass in a Translation to initialize the OutputVersion state. OutputRender should not know anything about what is stored within Translation, so they cannot access what is in the Translation concept to render anything. Plus, even if they did, Translation does not even store MediaFile--so you would have to recursively violate modularity to access the file associated with the Extraction.
-2: You are missing parts of your syncs that really show the relationship between your concept states. For your render sync, how do you imagine you are getting your original media file from the translation in order to create a final render?

My output relies on translation which relies on extractedResult. It's only in the extracted results we know the location of where text is in the img. How do I not pass those informaitons and be able to know where to place textbox on top of the image to re-render it?

Fix the concept design
