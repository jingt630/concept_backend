Here's a simple User concept designed according to your specifications, focusing on isolation and basic management:

## User Concept Specification

**concept** User \[User]

**purpose** To allow individuals to create and manage their own personal data within the system, ensuring privacy by preventing sharing or visibility with other users.

**principle** If a user registers with a unique username and password, their account is created in the system, storing their associated data; later, if the user chooses, their account and associated data can be deleted.

**state**
a set of Users with
username String
password String  // Stored in a way that ensures uniqueness and is not directly readable for security.
profilePic Image
email String
dateCreated DateTime

**actions**

**create** (username: String, password: String, profilePic: Image, email: String): (user: User)
**requires**
username is not already in use by any existing User
email is not already in use by any existing User
**effects**
creates a new User entity
sets username to input username
sets password to a securely hashed representation of the input password
sets profilePic to input profilePic
sets email to input email
sets dateCreated to the current DateTime
returns the identifier of the newly created User

**delete** (user: User)
**requires**
user exists in the set of Users
**effects**
removes the specified User entity and all associated data from the system

**changeProfilePic** (user: User, newProfilePic: Image)
**requires**
user exists in the set of Users
**effects**
sets the profilePic of the specified User to newProfilePic

***

### Explanation of Design Choices:

* **`concept User [User]`**:
  * The concept is named `User`.
  * It has a type parameter `User`. This is a common convention for concepts that manage entities of their own type. It allows the concept to refer to the type of user entities it manages in a generic way.

* **`purpose`**:
  * Clearly states the goal: enabling personal data management while ensuring privacy and isolation. It explicitly mentions preventing sharing and visibility.

* **`principle`**:
  * Describes the core lifecycle: registration (creation), data storage, and deletion. It highlights the uniqueness of the username and password, which is crucial for individual accounts.

* **`state`**:
  * `a set of Users with ...`: This declares that the state of the `User` concept is a collection of `User` entities.
  * `username String`: Stores the username.
  * `password String`: **Crucially, this is where the security and uniqueness lie.** In a real implementation, this would not store the raw password. Instead, it would store a secure, one-way hash of the password. The "uniqueness" requirement in the prompt would be enforced by the `create` action's precondition.
  * `profilePic Image`: Stores the user's profile picture.
  * `email String`: Stores the user's email address.
  * `dateCreated DateTime`: Records when the user account was created.

* **`actions`**:
  * **`create (username: String, password: String, profilePic: Image, email: String): (user: User)`**:
    * Takes all necessary information to create a new user.
    * **`requires`**: Enforces the uniqueness of `username` and `email`. This is where the system prevents two users from having the same username or email, without needing a separate authorization concept.
    * **`effects`**: Details how the state is updated. It emphasizes securely hashing the password (this is a design implication, not a literal code instruction here, but important for the principle) and setting the `dateCreated`. It returns the identifier of the newly created `User`.

  * **`delete (user: User)`**:
    * Takes the `User` entity to be deleted.
    * **`requires`**: Ensures the user actually exists before attempting deletion.
    * **`effects`**: Simply removes the `User` and all their associated data. Since the `User` concept is self-contained and doesn't store relationships to other users' data, deleting a user cleanly removes their entire footprint.

  * **`changeProfilePic (user: User, newProfilePic: Image)`**:
    * Allows a user to update their profile picture.
    * **`requires`**: Ensures the user exists.
    * **`effects`**: Updates the `profilePic` for that specific `User`.

**Why this meets your requirements:**

1. **Simple Creation and Deleting**: The `create` and `delete` actions are the core management functions.
2. **No Sharing, Seeing Each Other, or Accessing Other's Data**: The `state` only describes properties of an individual `User`. There are no relationships defined between `User` entities within this concept. The `delete` action removes all data *associated with that user*. The `create` action's preconditions prevent direct conflicts like duplicate usernames/emails.
3. **No Separate Authorization Concept Needed**: The `requires` clauses in the `create` action are sufficient for basic validation (uniqueness). Actions like `delete` and `changeProfilePic` implicitly operate on the `user` entity provided, meaning a user can only delete/change their *own* data because the concept only knows about *that specific user entity*. There's no mechanism within this concept for one user to specify another user as an argument to an action that modifies or accesses their data.

This concept is designed to be a foundational building block. If you were to build a more complex application, other concepts (like `Session` for tracking logged-in users, or `Post` for user-generated content) would likely interact with this `User` concept, but this `User` concept itself remains isolated regarding user-to-user data interaction.
