## User Concept: Self-Contained User Identity

This user concept focuses on providing an isolated, personal digital identity for each individual, without requiring any complex authorization mechanisms for inter-user interactions. The core principle is that each user operates in their own secure space, with no ability to interact with, view, or access the data of other users.

***

### Purpose:

To enable individuals to establish and manage a secure, private digital identity within the system. This identity serves as a unique identifier for their personal data, allowing them to create, store, and manage their information without any reliance on or interaction with other users.

***

### Principle:

**Isolated Self-Sufficiency:** Each user account is designed to be a self-contained unit. Data associated with a user is strictly private and inaccessible to any other user. The system will not facilitate any form of user discovery, sharing, or collaboration. The primary focus is on secure creation and deletion of individual user identities.

***

### Users:

A set of individual `User` entities, each possessing the following attributes:

* **`username`**: A `String` representing the unique identifier for the user. This is the primary way a user might identify themselves, though it's not used for discovery by others.
* **`password`**: A `String` representing the user's authentication credential. This must be unique in the system to ensure each user has a distinct login.
* **`profileImage`**: A `String` (or similar data type, like a URL or base64 encoded string) representing a visual identifier for the user's profile. This is personal to the user and not visible to anyone else.
* **`email`**: A `String` representing the user's email address. This is for administrative purposes related to their account (e.g., password resets) and not for user-to-user communication or discovery.
* **`dateCreated`**: A timestamp indicating when the user account was initially created.

**Constraint:**

* **Unique Passwords:** The `password` attribute must be unique across all `User` entities in the system. This is a fundamental security measure to prevent duplicate logins and ensure account integrity.

***

### Actions:

The following atomic actions are supported for managing `User` entities:

1. **`create()`**:
   * **Description:** This action allows for the creation of a new, unique `User` entity.
   * **Parameters:** `username`, `password`, `profileImage`, `email`.
   * **Behavior:**
     * The system verifies that the provided `username` and `password` are not already in use.
     * If a `username` or `password` conflict is detected, the creation fails, and an appropriate error is returned.
     * A new `User` entity is instantiated with the provided details and the current system timestamp for `dateCreated`.
     * The new `User` entity is added to the system's collection of users.

2. **`delete()`**:
   * **Description:** This action allows a user to permanently remove their own `User` entity and all associated data from the system.
   * **Parameters:** `username` (identifying the user to be deleted), `password` (for authentication).
   * **Behavior:**
     * The system authenticates the provided `username` and `password` to ensure the request is made by the legitimate owner of the account.
     * If authentication fails, the deletion fails, and an error is returned.
     * If authentication is successful, the `User` entity corresponding to the `username` is permanently removed from the system, along with any data directly linked to that user.
     * This action is irreversible.

3. **`changeProfilePic()`**:
   * **Description:** This action allows a user to update their `profileImage`.
   * **Parameters:** `username` (identifying the user), `password` (for authentication), `newProfileImage` (the new image data).
   * **Behavior:**
     * The system authenticates the provided `username` and `password`.
     * If authentication fails, the action fails, and an error is returned.
     * If authentication is successful, the `profileImage` attribute of the authenticated `User` entity is updated with the `newProfileImage`.

***

**No Other Authorization Required:**

This concept explicitly avoids any features that would necessitate further authorization logic, such as:

* **User Discovery:** No way to search for or find other users.
* **Data Sharing:** Users cannot grant access to their data to others.
* **Inter-User Communication:** No messaging or interaction features between users.
* **Permissions Management:** No roles, groups, or granular access controls beyond the self-contained nature of the user.

The system operates as a collection of independent, private user silos, where each user only interacts with their own data and their own identity.
