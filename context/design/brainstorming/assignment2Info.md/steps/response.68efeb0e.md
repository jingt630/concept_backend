# response:

You're right to point out that with the current setup, the "Simple User" concept is a bit limited if its actions are solely contained within "MediaManagement." For users to be truly "simple" but still functional and to introduce the possibility of interaction and sharing (even in a rudimentary way), we need to add actions that define their existence and potential beyond just managing media.

Here's a breakdown of actions that should be added to the "Simple User" concept, considering the limitations you've described (no direct communication or sharing *yet*, but laying the groundwork):

## Actions to Add to the "Simple User" Concept:

These actions focus on the user's presence, basic identification, and their ability to *have* things or *interact with the system* in a fundamental way.

**1. Identity and Existence:**

* **`create_user(username: str, initial_password: str)`:**
  * **Purpose:** This is the most fundamental action. It allows for the instantiation of a "Simple User" object.
  * **Description:** Creates a new user account with a unique username and a secure password. This establishes the user's presence in the system.

* **`authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool`:**
  * **Purpose:** Allows a user to prove their identity to the system.
  * **Description:** Verifies if the provided username and password match an existing user. Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise. This is crucial for any further actions.

* **`deactivate_user(user_id: str)`:**
  * **Purpose:** Allows an administrator or the user themselves (with sufficient permissions) to disable their account.
  * **Description:** Marks a user account as inactive, preventing further logins or actions.

* **`delete_user(user_id: str)`:**
  * **Purpose:** Permanently removes a user account and associated data (if applicable and allowed by policy).
  * **Description:** Removes a user from the system. This should be a sensitive operation.

**2. Basic State and Information:**

* **`get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> UserProfile`:**
  * **Purpose:** Retrieves basic information about a user.
  * **Description:** Returns a `UserProfile` object containing non-sensitive details like username, creation date, last login date, etc. This is useful for displaying user lists or providing context.

* **`update_user_settings(user_id: str, **settings)`:**
  * **Purpose:** Allows users to customize certain aspects of their experience.
  * **Description:** Enables users to modify their account settings (e.g., display name, notification preferences, privacy settings â€“ even if these have limited impact *now*).

**3. Establishing Ownership and Association (Crucial for Future Sharing):**

* **`assign_media_to_user(user_id: str, media_item_id: str)`:**
  * **Purpose:** This is a foundational action for enabling future sharing. It establishes that a piece of media *belongs* to a specific user.
  * **Description:** Associates a `MediaItem` with a `SimpleUser`. This is how a user "owns" their uploaded or created media. Even if they can't share it directly *yet*, the system knows who is responsible for it.

* **`list_user_media(user_id: str) -> list[MediaItem]`:**
  * **Purpose:** Allows a user to see what media they have associated with them.
  * **Description:** Retrieves all `MediaItem` objects that have been assigned to the specified user. This is the user's "personal library."

**4. Minimal System Interaction (Beyond Media Management):**

* **`request_support(user_id: str, message: str)`:**
  * **Purpose:** Provides a basic channel for users to interact with the system administrators or support staff.
  * **Description:** Creates a support ticket or message from the user to the system's support channel. This is a form of indirect communication.

**Why these actions are important for a "Simple User":**

* **Existence and Authentication:** A user needs to exist and be able to prove who they are to do anything in the system.
* **Basic Management of Self:** Users often need to manage their own basic information or settings.
* **Ownership:** The concept of "owning" media is fundamental for any kind of interaction or sharing, even if it's just seeing their own stuff. This lays the groundwork for granting permissions or sharing links later.
* **Limited Interaction:** Actions like requesting support show that the user is not completely isolated, even if they can't directly talk to other users.

**How these bridge the gap:**

While these actions don't directly enable inter-user communication or sharing, they:

* **Define the User's Identity:** They make the "Simple User" a tangible entity within the system.
* **Establish Ownership:** This is the critical first step for any future sharing mechanism. Once the system knows *who* owns *what*, it can start implementing features like sharing permissions or public links.
* **Provide Basic Functionality:** Users can now log in, see their media, and even ask for help.
* **Lay the Groundwork:** These actions are the building blocks for more complex interactions later. For example, `assign_media_to_user` could be extended to `share_media_with_user` or `set_media_visibility`.

By adding these actions, the "Simple User" concept becomes more than just a placeholder that can only manage media. It becomes an active participant in the system, with a defined identity and the potential for future growth into more interactive roles.
