Here's a breakdown of the changes you've decided to make for your application, based on the prompt and the provided materials:

## Changes from Initial Concepts to Final Application Design

The core functionality of your application, **TEPKonjac**, has undergone significant evolution, moving from a conceptually broad "media" translation tool to a more focused, dynamic, and modular application.

### Key Shifts in Application Design:

1. **Media Type Focus: From General Media to Image Files:**
   * **Before Concept:** The initial application was designed to handle various media types, including "images, scanned paper, video, or voice recording."
   * **New Decision:** You've decided to **cut down the scope to just image files.** This implies a significant simplification of the core processing logic, particularly for the "TextExtraction" and "OutputRender" concepts. Video and voice processing would have introduced complexities like temporal synchronization, frame-by-frame analysis, and audio transcription, which are now bypassed. This also means the UI sketches for video editing are likely no longer representative of the final product.

2. **User Scope: From Single Local User to Dynamic and Collaborative:**
   * **Before Concept:** The application was envisioned as a "single user and local storage" tool, akin to Adobe applications. This implied a local installation and user data residing solely on the user's device.
   * **New Decision:** You are changing this to **"not make it single local user anymore for requirement of needing to be dynamic."** This is a crucial shift.
     * **Dynamic:** This suggests an online component, potentially involving cloud storage, remote processing, or real-time collaboration. It implies the application will need to handle user accounts, data synchronization across devices, and potentially server-side infrastructure for processing.
     * **Implication for Concepts:** Concepts like "MediaManagement" might need to be re-architected to handle cloud storage and shared folders rather than just local file paths. "Context" extraction could become more sophisticated by leveraging a larger, shared database of previously translated content or user-contributed cultural nuances.

3. **Conceptual Modularity: From Integrated to Modular Concepts:**
   * **Before Concept:** The concepts, while distinct, were presented in a somewhat integrated flow. The synchronizations illustrated a clear pipeline.
   * **New Decision:** You've decided to **change so concepts are modular now.**
     * **Implication:** This means each concept (MediaManagement, TextExtraction, Translation, OutputRender) will be designed as an independent, reusable unit. They might interact through well-defined APIs rather than tightly coupled dependencies. This enhances maintainability, testability, and allows for easier swapping or upgrading of individual components. For example, a new, more advanced translation engine could be plugged in without disrupting the rest of the application. This also aligns well with a dynamic, potentially cloud-based architecture where different services can be hosted and scaled independently.

### Repercussions of These Changes on the Concepts:

* **MediaManagement:**
  * **File Path:** The concept of `filePath` will likely need to be abstracted to represent cloud storage locations or references to cloud objects, rather than local directory paths.
  * **Context:** The `context` attribute could become richer, potentially drawing from a shared knowledge base across users or being more robustly stored and retrieved from cloud storage.
  * **`upload` Action:** This will now involve uploading to a remote storage service.
  * **`createFolder` Action:** This will likely translate to creating folders/directories within a cloud storage system.

* **TextExtraction:**
  * **MediaFile Dependency:** While still dependent on `MediaFile`, the `MediaFile` object itself might now be a pointer to cloud-stored data.
  * **Processing Location:** Text extraction might be performed either locally on smaller chunks of data or offloaded to cloud-based processing services for scalability, especially with dynamic requirements.
  * **`position`:** For image files, `Coordinates` remains relevant.

* **Translation:**
  * **Contextual Awareness:** With a dynamic user base, the ability to learn from *other users'* translations within the same folder (as mentioned in the user journey) becomes a powerful feature. This means the `context` for translation can be significantly enhanced beyond just the current folder's content.
  * **`targetLanguage`:** The system might need to support a wider range of languages and potentially user-defined custom languages or dialects.

* **OutputRender:**
  * **`base` Attribute:** The `base` attribute in `OutputVersion` will reference the original image file (now likely cloud-stored).
  * **`render` Action:** This might involve generating a new image file with overlaid text, which will then be stored back in cloud storage.
  * **`export` Action:** This will now be about downloading a rendered image file from cloud storage to the user's local device. The `type` conversion might still apply, but the `destination` will be a local path on the user's device.

In summary, the shifts from a single-user, local, image-only application to a dynamic, potentially collaborative, image-focused application with modular concepts represent a move towards a more scalable, robust, and feature-rich platform. The core idea of facilitating faster and more accurate foreign media consumption remains, but the technical implementation and architecture will be significantly different to accommodate these new requirements.
