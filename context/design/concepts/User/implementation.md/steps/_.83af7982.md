# User (User Management)

**Concept:** User \[User]

**Purpose:** To enable individuals to create and manage their personal data within the system, ensuring privacy by preventing data sharing or visibility with other users.

**Principle:** A user can register with a unique email, which creates their account and stores their associated data. Later, if the user chooses, their account and associated data can be deleted.

**State**

A set of `User` with:

* `username` (String): The user's chosen username.
* `password` (String): A securely hashed representation of the user's password, ensuring uniqueness and non-readability.
* `profilePic` (Image): The user's profile picture.
* `email` (String): The user's unique email address.
* `dateCreated` (DateTime): The date and time when the user account was created.

**Actions**

* `create(username: String, password: String, profilePic: Image, email: String): User`
  * **Requires:**
    * `username` and `password` must consist solely of alphabets, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
    * `email` must not be in use by any existing `User`.
  * **Effects:**
    * Creates a new `User` entity.
    * Sets `username` to the input `username`.
    * Sets `password` to a securely hashed representation of the input `password`.
    * Sets `profilePic` to the input `profilePic`.
    * Sets `email` to the input `email`.
    * Sets `dateCreated` to the current `DateTime`.
    * Returns the identifier of the newly created `User`.

* `delete(user: User)`
  * **Requires:** `user` must exist in the set of `Users`.
  * **Effects:**
    * Removes the specified `User` entity and all associated data from the system.

* `changeProfilePic(user: User, newProfilePic: Image)`
  * **Requires:** `user` must exist in the set of `Users`.
  * **Effects:**
    * Sets the `profilePic` of the specified `User` to `newProfilePic`.
