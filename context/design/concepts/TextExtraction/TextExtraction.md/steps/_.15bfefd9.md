# Concept 2

**Concept** TextExtraction

**Purpose** Extract text from uploaded media for the AI to learn and translate

**Principle** Given a MediaFile, AI would run extraction to recognize text within the media, and produce a transcript with metadata for the media. One media can have many ExtractionResults.

**State**
a set of ExtractionResults with
\- imagePath (FilePath)
\- extractedText (String)
\- position(Location)
\- textId (String)

```
a set of Location with
    - an ExtractionResult
    - two Coordinate (Number,Number)
```

**Actions**

extractTextFromMedia(image:FilePath): (result: ExtractionResult)
**require:** image exists and accessible
**effect:** create new ExtractionResults that is associated with the image

editExtractText(extractedText:ExtractionResult, newText:String)
**require** extractedText exists
**effect** modify extractedText in extraction to newText

editLocation(extractedText:ExtractionResult, fromCoord: Coordinate, toCoord: Coordinate)
**require** extractedText exists, the coordinates doesn't include negative numbers
**effect** change position of extractedText to a new location with fromCoord and toCoord that gives us the area of image that the extractedText occupies if a rectangle is drawn from FromCoord to ToCoord

addExtractionTxt(media: FilePath, fromCoord: Coordinate, toCoord: Coordinate):(result: ExtractionResult)
**require** media exists, numbers are non-negative.
**effect** Creates a new ExtractionResult with the same media, initiate extractedText as empty, an unique textId
basing off of the filepath, and the location created from the two given coordinates.

deleteExtraction(textId:String)
**require** textId exists
**effect** remove the extractedResult with textId
