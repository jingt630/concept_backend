# response:

Here are the test cases for the `TextExtraction` concept, covering its operational principle and interesting scenarios.

First, ensure you have the necessary setup:

1. **`deno.json`**: Make sure it includes the correct imports and tasks as previously defined.
2. **`@utils/database.ts`**: Ensure this file is correctly set up for MongoDB connection and ID generation.
3. **`@utils/types.ts`**: For `ID` and `Empty`.
4. **`gemini-llm.ts`**: The AI interaction module.
5. **`TextExtraction.ts`**: The concept implementation itself.

You'll also need a dummy image file for testing. Let's assume you have a file named `test_image.png` in a `data/` directory. For the purpose of this test, we'll assume this image contains text that the AI can recognize.
