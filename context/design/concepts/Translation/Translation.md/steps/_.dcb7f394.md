# Concept 3

**Concept** Translation\[TextExtraction]

**Purpose** Provide AI-assisted draft translation, which can later be refined by the user.

**Principle** When the AI extracts the text from the media, it translates to the target language the user selected. The user can re-edit the translation if they want to.

**State**

a set of Translations with

```
- source (ExtractionResult)
- targetLanguage (String)
- translatedText (String)
```

**actions**

createTranslation(result: ExtractionResult, targetLanguage: String): (translation:Translation)
**require:** result exists, targetLanguage is a real language
**effect:** generate a translation linked to the ExtractionResult

edit(translation: Translation, newText:String)
**require:** translation exist
**effect:** change the translatedText in translation to newText
