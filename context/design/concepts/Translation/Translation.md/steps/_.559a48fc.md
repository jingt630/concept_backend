# Concept 3

**Concept** Translation\[TextExtraction]

**Purpose** Provide AI-assisted draft translation, which can later be refined by the user.

**Principle** When the AI extracts the text from the media, it translates to the target language the user selected. The user can re-edit the translation if they want to.

**State**

a set of Translations with

```
- imagePath (filePath)
- transTextId (String)
- targetLanguage (String)
- originalText (String)
- translatedText (String)
```

**actions**

createTranslation(imagePath: filePath, targetLanguage: String, originalText:String, originalTextId: String): (translation:Translation)
**require:** image exists, targetLanguage is a real language
**effect:** generate a Translation with an unique transTextId basing off of imagePath and the originalTextId\[^1], translatedText generated from AI in the targetLanguage of the originalText, and store the targetLanguage and originalText given.

editTranslation(translation: Translation, newText:String)
**require:** translation exist
**effect:** change the translatedText in translation to newText

changeLanguage(extractedText:ExtractionResult,newTargetLang:String)
**require:** extractedText exists, newTargetLang is a real language
**effect:** change the targetLanguage to the newTargetLang, set translatedText
to be a new translated version in the newTargetLang generated from the AI
\[^1:] We can have the same text appear in multiple places of an image, and I would like
one to one pairing of the translation and extractionResult
