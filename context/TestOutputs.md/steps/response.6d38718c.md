\--- Scenario 2: Change language to the same language ---
no error here yet
The English translation of "A document in English" is:

**A document in English.**
Created translation with ID: original:doc:456:en:1760939475334
no error here yet
"Empty for now" can be translated to English in a few ways, depending on the nuance you want to convey:

* **"Empty for now"**: This is the most direct and common translation.
* **"Currently empty"**: This is a slightly more formal or descriptive option.
* **"Blank for now"**: This is suitable if you're referring to a space, a document, or a slot that is waiting to be filled.
* **"Vacant for now"**: This is often used for physical spaces like rooms or positions.

The best translation will depend on the context.
