# Changes made in Assignment 4B
- incorporate db access, uploading, and deleting to change states of user's data in the DB
- Also re-edited the code to allow AI work smoothly in the concepts that require responses from AI
- changed test.ts for the codes in the src folder to test the new codes
- changed my API key because of security leakage
